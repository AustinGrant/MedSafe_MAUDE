","The investigation conducted by the field service engineer (fse) concluded that the system error codes 23008 and 212 experienced by the site were associated with the left master tool manipulator (mtml) and multiple servo driver (msd).The mtm refers to the master controllers which provide the means for the surgeon to control the instruments and endoscope inside the patient from the surgeon's side console.One mtm is assigned to the surgeon's left hand (mtml) and one to his right (mtmr).The system contains two msd pca boards which provide drive current to the servo motors associated with each degree of freedom for each system arm.The system was repaired by replacing the affected mtm and msd.The system alarm (system generated fault codes) functioned as designed and there was no injury to the patient.System error code 23008 appears when the da vinci s safety system determines that the angular position of one or more robotic joints on the specified manipulator, as measured by that joint's primary control sensor (encoder) and the secondary sensor (potentiometer), were out of specified tolerance for agreement.System error code 212 occurs when the actual voltage to drive current through the motors deviates from the expected voltage by a specified amount.Upon determining this condition, the safety system puts da vinci s in a recoverable safe state.The mtml and msd board were returned to isi for evaluation.Engineering was able to duplicate the system error code 212 on axis 4 of the mtml during a harness wiggle test.The main cable harness was replaced to repair the mtml.Functional testing of the msd board installed on an isi in-house test system found that it functioned within specification and there were no system error codes generated.As of september 10, 2013, there have been no reported recurrences of the issue at this hospital.Based on the information provided, this complaint is being reported due to the following conclusion: the surgeon made the decision to convert to open surgical techniques after encountering recurring system error codes with the da vinci s surgical system.
